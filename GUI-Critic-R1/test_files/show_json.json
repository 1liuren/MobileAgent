Possible actions include \"click\" / \"left_click\" at (x,y) position, \"long press\" at (x,y) position, \"swipe\" from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2), \"scroll\" down or up, \"drag\" from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2), \"type\" (text content), \"back\", \"home\", \"enter\" and so on. \n\nUser instructions are usually complex and may include several detailed requirements. In some steps, the action decided by the mobile agent may be wrong.\nNow, you are a critic model used to evaluate the agent's decision. I will provide you with the following information:\n1. User instruction.\n2. History: The action history of the agent in the previous steps. \n3. Decision: The decision of the agent for this step.\n4. Image: The screenshot before executing this action. If the action contains positional parameters (such as click and swipe), the interaction area is marked with a translucent red circle or red arrow. \n\nFirstly, you need to understand the purpose of the decision. Pay attention to analyzing the interface elements in the screenshot (such as button position, text content, etc.). If there are red marks, focus on the action position. You can take appropriate account of the history information. \nThen, based on the given information, carefully analyze the decision given by the agent for the current step:\n1. Decision Analysis\n(1). Observation: Observe the screenshot and analyze the state without considering the user's instruction.\n- Focus on the operable or informative elements related to the operational decision. \n(2). Possible Result: Speculate the most possible result of executing this decision.\n- Predicts the screenshot change after the operation.\n- Whether to promote the progress of core tasks.\n(3). Critique: Determine whether the decision is correct and explain why.\n- Focus on historical operations. \n- Based on the previous analysis and the history, determine if this decision supports the completion of the instruction. \n- Only perform actions specified in the instructions. \n- Home button is the correct choice for switching apps. \n- Both clicking a suggestion and Enter are correct when searching. \n\n2. Based on the above analysis, determine whether this decision is \"Correct\" or \"Incorrect\".\n3. Reflection: If correct, retell the action; if incorrect, suggest a better action. Propose a one-step action for the current obversation, like click, swipe (with direction), type (with information), Home, Back, or Terminate (in 20 words).\n\nBelow is the information for the current step:\n1. User instruction:\nOpen agoda. Search temporary apartments in New York through agoda homes. Move-in date is July 1, move-out date is August 31. Monthly budget is less than $3000.\n2. History:\n Step 1: Swipe through the home screens to locate the Agoda app or its folder.\n; Step 2: Tap on the Agoda app to open it.\n; Step 3: Tap on the 'Homes & Apts' option to proceed and start searching for apartments.\n; Step 4: Tap on the location field where it currently says \"Bali\" to change it to New York.\n; Step 5: Type 'New York' in the destination search field.\n; Step 6: Tap on 'New York (NY)' to select it as the destination.\n; Step 7: Tap on the move-in date field to change it to July 1.\n; Step 8: Tap on July 1 to set it as the move-in date.\n; Step 9: Swipe up on the calendar to reveal the months of July and August.\n; Step 10: Tap on August 31 to set the move-out date.\n; Step 11: Tap the 'OK' button to confirm the selected dates.\n; Step 12: Tap on the 'Search' button to proceed with finding available apartments.\n; \n3. Decision:\nAction: {'action': 'click', 'coordinate': [1271, 1715]}\n4. Image is the screenshot of this step.\n\nAssess the current decision's correctness in the following format:\n<thinking>\n**Observation**: Describe the screenshot.\n**Possible Result**: Analysis from the possible result perspective.\n**Critique**: Criticize why the decision is correct or incorrect.\n</thinking>\n<score>\nCorrect or Incorrect\n</score>\n<suggestion>\nIf correct, provide a brief summary; if incorrect, suggest a better decision briefly.\n</suggestion>", "solution": "Correct \n Tap on the 'Apply' button to confirm the accommodation type selections and proceed with the search."}
